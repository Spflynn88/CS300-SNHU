# CS300-SNHU
SNHU CS-300 Week 8 project

During the CS-300 course I worked on understanding and implementing a selection of data structures. Data structures are methods of holding data in a program and important for any program of any size. They are methods of storing data in a way that makes them easy and fast to read and write. For example, during my final project I used a binary search tree in order to store course information in a way that makes it quickly searchable.

Although I was able to understand all the data structures we used during this course there were several things I needed extra help with while working. One problem that I had was that I needed to brush up on how points worked. Another issue was that while taking this class I was also taking a class that used java instead of C++. This lead to a lot of frustration and typing errors during the course of programming. I had heard of many of these structures and used several of them in the past but got more hands on experience with them during this course and feel like I have an overall better understanding. I has helped me improve upon some of my other projects that I work on as a hobby.
